========================= Egg's Lap Mod v1.0.1 =========================

Thank you for downloading Egg's Lap Mod! (E.L.M. for short)
A mod for Pizza Tower that aims to rework the Lap 3 concept by adding QOL changes and many new features such as:
 1. A new ranking system.
 2. Edited rooms to make lapping much easier.
 3. Chef Tasks for completing new challenges.
 4. And much, much more!

======================== INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ========================

Delta Patcher Install:
 1. Download Delta Patcher from here: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
 2. Open it and choose Pizza Tower's original data.win file for "Original File:"
 3. Choose the "EggsLapMod.xdelta" file for "XDelta Patch:"
 4. Replace Pizza Tower's english.txt file in the .../lang directory with E.L.M.'s english.txt.
 5. Drop the "EggsLapMod" folder in your ...sound/Desktop directory as well.

NOTES:
 1. Egg's Lap Mod is compatible with Pizza Oven and Delta Patcher. Any non-Delta Patcher based mod loaders such as ToppinLoader are incompatible with this mod.
 2. Make sure none of your Pizza Tower files are modified by verifying the integrity of the game files on Steam.
 3. If installing with Pizza Oven, Make sure that its up to date, or you will get errors.
 4. Before installing other mods, or when reverting back to vanilla, it is recommended to delete everything in the lang folder and verify the game files, as to avoid any language file related issues.
